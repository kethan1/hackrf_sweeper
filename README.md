# HackRF Sweeper

> **A reimplementation of hackrf_sweep as a library: TSCM for Joe the plumber**


![Screenshot](images/plot_demo.png)

## Introduction

This is a refactoring or reimplementation of `hackrf_sweep` as a library, providing a carefully chosen API
to leverage the HackRF sweeping capabilities in a reusable, low-frustration fashion. The library provides
support for user-supplied callbacks to process raw transfer buffers or the already calculated FFT bins,
including a bypass mode to allow for entirely off-loading the data processing to the caller. It also
implements a rudimentary opaque mutex (locking) state for multi-thread applications.

A demo application is a re-implementation of the original `hackrf_sweep` tool as a CURVE-encrypted publisher
sending `msgpack` frames to any receivers subscribed to it. A companion demo application is included in
the form of a Python program that processes these frames and generates a real-time plot of the RF spectrum,
the last peak detections and the absolute peaks -maximum observed-.

Past projects attempting to provide similar capabilities include hackrf-spectrum-analyzer (https://github.com/pavsa/hackrf-spectrum-analyzer). `hackrf_sweeper` provides continuous sweeping support instead of one-shot sweeps, besides the aforementioned improvements.

We intend to design and develop a GNU Radio block related to this library.

## Highlights

 - Reusable state across multiple sweeps.
 - Ease of use for initialization and reconfiguration.
 - Support for user-supplied callbacks:
   - Raw USB transfer data access (with optional bypass mode disabling FFT processing).
   - *FFT bins ready* access.
 - Explicit error codes during configuration.
 - Support for external mutex APIs at the right places (better multi-thread tolerance).
 - Easy integration in third-party projects: minimal set of APIs needed to boot.
 - Developed with future merging into upstream hackrf in mind.

## Documentation

The documentation is automatically published upon changes to this repository at:

### Generating locally
The documentation can be generated like so:

```
$ cd docs/doxygen
$ doxygen Doxyfile
$ ls -ln
total 124
-rw-rw-r-- 1 2300 2300 116467 Sep 30 18:42 Doxyfile

```

## Building

### Dependencies

The library depends on `libhackrf` and FFTW. The ZMQ demo application requires `libczmq` and `libzmq`.

For Debian users:

```
$ sudo apt-get install libhackrf-dev libczmq-dev libzmq5 libmsgpack-dev
```

### Compilation

Clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/subreption/hackrf_sweeper.git
$ cd hackrf_sweeper
```

Proceed with the usual CMake build process:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

### Running the demo ZMQ application

The user must generate keys conforming to the modern ZMQ certificate format:

```
$ cat ../test-keys/server.key
#   ****  Generated on 2024-09-28 13:53:55 by CZMQ  ****
#   ZeroMQ CURVE Public Certificate
#   Exchange securely, or use a secure mechanism to verify the contents
#   of this file after exchange. Store public certificates in your home
#   directory, in the .curve subdirectory.

metadata
    generator = "hackrf_sweeper_zmq"
curve
    public-key = "x>fs%(=GAoN>OB/!%@a#UOwl+qXy]o!E7x61r/f."
```

Once the keys for the server have been generated, the demo application can run:

```
$ ./hackrf_sweeper_zmqpub -S ../test-keys/server.key
call hackrf_sample_rate_set(20.000 MHz)
call hackrf_baseband_filter_bandwidth_set(15.000 MHz)

```
With `hackrf_sweeper_zmqpub` still running, the plotting demo application can be run like so:

```
$ ./demo/hackrf_sweeper_zmq2plot.py  -k ./test-keys
Client key pair found in ./test-keys

```

**Remember to specify a key directory to hold the CURVE certificates**.
